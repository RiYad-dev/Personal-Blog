                        Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance
                        to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you
                        are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food
                        is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts
                        quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid
                        disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep and happening. Hosts the famous
                        "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.

                        history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners.
                        Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the
                        accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.</p>

                        <p>It might sound oxymoronic, but Avengers Endgame left us with a wholesome heartbreak. Our
                            heroes brought back their fallen and saved the world from Thanos’s cosmic destruction plan.
                            Yet, there was a price to pay, and our beloved Iron\Man AKA Tony Stark paid it. While it was
                            undoubtedly painful to bid goodbye, the rest of our favourites seemed to have found peace.
                            And so they should. In Spider-Man: Far From Home, the next step after the death and
                            destruction of Avengers, our friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man AKA Peter Parker is off on a
                            well-deserved break with his classmates. While the loss of Tony Stark looms over him at all
                            times, he just wants to leave aside the superhero suit for a while and finally enjoy life
                            like a 16-year-old should. And like every teenager, he wants to get that first kiss from the
                            girl he likes.</p>

                        <p>2019’s The Lion King is a ‘live action’ remake of the 1994 original animation flick which
                            went on to become an iconic film for all ages. Those who have watched the original Lion King
                            will vouch for its strong emotional connect, rousing, heartbreaking moments that left a

                            original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in
                            the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better
                            instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into
                            the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to
                            appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>

                        <p>Hollywood has a distinct ability to breathe life into objects and the Toy Story franchise is
                            perhaps the best example. This time, writers Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom introduce
                            some new characters in this emotional roller coaster. While we still have the good ol’ Woody
                            holding the center stage, the focus is now on Forky. As the name suggests, it’s just a fork
                            with strings for hands and broken wooden sticks for toes. But the fact that you feel
                            instantly connected with him and root for him symbolises the brilliance of the film’s
                            nuanced writing and near flawless execution. Tony Hale’s perfectly pitched voice and an
                            endearing character arc gives him the edge. Director Josh Cooley promptly pulls Toy Story 4
                            into the action mode as the motley group of toys are taken on a road trip. The fun adventure
                            begins right from the start, as we see Woody inadvertently getting in trouble for always
                            doing the right thing.</p>

                            In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop
                            manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could
                            include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year.
                            While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the
                            new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have,
                            especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured
                            block.

                            The perceived scale of the Amazon blazes received global attention this summer. However,
                            international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which
                            claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An
                            international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number
                            of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest
                            number since 2010.
